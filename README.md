# WB-Squad-List-Numbers
A small program to generate a dictionary of squad names and the number of players in them (for WB).
This tool is intended for ***recreational*** purposes and not to attack War Brokers.

### How to use the tool (pre-requisites):
- (If on Windows, you'll need to install python first)
- Install the *requests*, *bs4* (BeautifulSoup4), and *tqdm* libraries
  - For standard python installations:<br>- `pip install requests`<br>- `pip install bs4`<br>- `pip install tqdm`
  - Users of Anaconda's Python distribution can either install pip (`conda install pip`) or install libraries via conda<br>- (e.g. `conda install bs4`)

Following this, you can then run the python program.
